# RoBACHtic-Symphony
ECE 3011 Design Fundamentals Project

## Project Description

In the realm of junior-design team initiatives, we undertook a project focused on the development of an educational robot kit. This kit, specifically designed for 5th-grade students, imparts comprehensive knowledge on discerning a violin's bow movement, placement, and techniques—particularly bow posture—while performing musical compositions featuring diverse notes. The device seamlessly integrates with a MIDI piano keyboard, utilizing user input to produce two outputs: a robotic arm executing bow movements corresponding to the "mapped" string and an audio sample replicating the played note.

Comprising a team of four students—three specializing in Electrical Engineering and one in Computer Engineering—we dedicated ourselves to the intricate aspects of Mechanical, Electrical, and Software engineering. In conjunction with the hardware and software components, we meticulously crafted four essential artifacts: a Design Document, Bill of Materials (BOM), Lesson Plan, and Notebook. Notably, our Lesson Plan aligns meticulously with the Georgia Standards of Excellence (GSE) for both Music and Computer Science curricula.

In the context of this collaborative effort, I assumed a leadership role in spearheading the software development aspect of the project. This multifaceted undertaking served as the focal point of our endeavors within the framework of ECE 3011 - Design Fundamentals.
